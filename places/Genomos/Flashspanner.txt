Gnomes tend away from large towns, so Flashspanner is something of an oddity.

Originally a village, it was rapidly built up by Glenaria Flashspanner along with the Guild of Artificers. The town adopted the eponym after Glenaria's death.

Although predominantly gnomish, other races aren't uncommon, and talented outsiders are now even welcomed into the guild.
