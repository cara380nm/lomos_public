The town of Cleb, the closest thing to a safe place on the island of Khthon, is completely enclosed on three sides by tall, well defended walls. The fourth side faces the sea. Ruled by a small cabal of merchants, Cleb is completely independant from the anarchy of the rest of the island. Goblinoids are forbidden from entering the walls.

In holding the barbarian tribes at bay, Cleb allows traders to do a very prosperous trade taking goods in by sea and exchanging them for minerals and ores to be shipped back to civilisation. The single harbour serving Khton, and the draconian penalties, make it easy to enforce the exorbitant customs duties.
