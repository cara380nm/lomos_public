The last significant refuge of the goblinoids, Khthon is a wooded island just north of Genomos. The small independent trading hub of Cleb, protected by its huge walls is relatively safe. The remainder of the island is not a place for the unwary.

The leaders of several competing bands claim dominion over Khthon, though in reality they range from despots of minor settlements to nomadic brigands.

As the goblinoid races have gradually been cleared from most of Genomos over the last 200 years bringing it relative peace, Khthon has been consumed with increasing strife.
