# Lomos setting

![Map of area](./maps/lomos_sea.png "Lomos map")

## Overview

These are notes for a homebrew campaign setting. Generally things are stock 3.5 D&D, but with perhaps a mild steampunk flavour. Mechanical power is expensive, bulky, and fault prone, so this mostly means elite vehicles and buildings. Hand weapons and personal equipment are generally stock 3.5.

## Geography

The campaign occurs in the vicinity of the Lomos Sea, which stretches between Arzitia to the south, Lomos to the north, Gressen to the west, and Drakelond to the east.

### Arzitan continent

#### Arzita

Arzita is a large (mostly desert) sultanate controlled by the house of Hamhimri. In recent years power has been held by a vizier, as Sultan Hamhimri XVI is not yet of age. Sultans have tend not to reach adulthood, and adults in line to the throne tend to meet with accidents.

#### Freecrags

Freecrags is the area north of Arzitia. It consists of several tiny monarchies, city-states, and stateless territories. Many areas are contested.

##### Lastport

A large city which handles almost all goods coming to west Arzitia and Freecrags. It is a small duchy incororating the lands north to the mountains, and westwards to Mavi. Nominally it is a protectorate of Arzitia, but in practice it is independent. Mostly human, though with a large contingent of other races.

##### Mavi

A small city of 12000, positioned on the edge of the desert where the land is still just capable of sustaining crops. The city is notable for its unusual structure, effectively ruled over by guilds. It has an usually long wall surrounding almost the entire city. The wall is a callback to the days of Dragon raids, but now acts simply to regulate population movement.

### Genomos archipelego

#### Genomos

Genomos has the largest population of gnomes in the Lomos sea, and a smattering of other civilised races.

Goblins are relatively rare now, though travel between settlements isn't always safe. Travellers should still be prepared for an occassional brigand attack. Those foolish enough to step off the main tracks should expect to meet more exotic foes. In particular, tales are still told of the Drail, a large grey supposedly invulnerable monster.

The island is surrounded by very shallow water. Port Ansil on the west side is the only location that can accomodate a Carrack's draught. Most of the island is wooded, and the main trail takes the long route to the north, avoiding the thicker wooded areas and saltmarshes.

##### Flashspanner

Gnomes tend away from large towns, so Flashspanner is something of an oddity.

Originally a village, it was rapidly built up by the Guild of Artificers, founded by Glenaria Flashspanner. The town adopted the eponym after Glenaria's death

Although predominantly gnomish, other races aren't uncommon, and talented outsiders are now even welcomed into the guild. The town is the main producer of dirigibles, and most crews have a Flashspanner gnome or two.

Its an unusual town, some buildings are traditional gnomish dugouts, some are wood, and some use experimental constructions. The town still integrates somewhat with the woodland around it, with lots of trees, many turf roofs and unpaved areas.

##### Port Ansil

The only port on Genomos capable of taking large ships. Port Ansil is an autonomous city under Lord Ansil, but taxes are low, law is minimal, and the populance complacent.

Like many ports it is quite cosmopolitan, though primarily human and gnomish. To humans the defensive walls are overkill, but gnomish memories remember the hobgoblins hordes the walls repelled.

The city has long since sprawled outside its walls, and the focus now is on trade.

#### Khthon

The last significant refuge of the goblinoids, Khthon is a wooded island just north of Genomos. The small independent trading hub of Cleb, protected by its huge walls is relatively safe. The remainder of the island is not a place for the unwary.

The leaders of several competing bands claim dominion over Khthon, though in reality they range from despots of minor settlements to nomadic brigands.

Goblinoids have gradually been cleared from most of Genomos over the last 200 years, bringing it relative peace, but whole tribes have been forced on to Khthon instead.  The tribes, forced to compete for resources, have made Khthon far less stable than Genomos ever was.

##### Cleb

The town of Cleb, the closest thing to a safe place on the island of Khthon, is completely enclosed on three sides by tall, well defended walls. The fourth side faces the sea. Ruled by a small cabal of merchants, Cleb is completely independant from the anarchy of the rest of the island. Goblinoids are forbidden from entering the walls.

In holding the barbarian tribes at bay, Cleb allows traders to do a very prosperous trade taking goods in by sea and exchanging them for minerals and ores to be shipped back to civilisation. The single harbour serving Khthon make it easy to enforce the exorbitant customs duties. The penalties for smuggling are draconian.

### Other
#### Gressen

Gressen is a temperate island south of Lomos. It might be considered the most civilised island in the Lomos sea. Rich, prosperous, and relatively safe, it is ruled from Gressen city by a stable monarchy. The population is primarily elvish, though humans, gnomes, dwarves and halflings are usually tolerated if not always embraced.

##### Brevnia

The southern city of Brevnia is widely renowned as a cultural hub. From the nobility's richly ornamented palaces that dominate the skyline down to the fine goods its artisans export, the city is considered a symbol of class. It is somewhat more diverse than any other cities on the island but elves still dominate everywhere except the port district.

Brevnia's exports aren't always welcome. The city is renowned for a bohemian underclass of writers, bards, and revolutionaries who have been known to start movements and influence the destiny of kingdoms.

#### Layover

A temperate, bordering on subtropical, island roughly situated rougly equidistant between Port Ansil, Brevnia, and Avigna.

The island shares its name with the port of Layover. The port city is the only substantial development. The north of the island is agricultural, and the remainder of the island is largely shrubland/grassland.

The city is cosmopolitan, though mostly human. There are some very insular rural gnomish and halfling communities on the island.
