# Mavi

A small city state of 12000, positioned on the edge of the desert where the land is still just capable of sustaining crops. The city is notable for its unusual structure, effectively ruled over by guilds. It has an usually long wall surrounding almost the entire city. The wall is a callback to the days of Dragon raids, but now acts simply to regulate population movement.

Economically it acts as a trade centre for the desert dwellers to the south, the dwarvern miners to the north, and the sea traffic from Lastport to the east. It is also the cultural centre in the region.

## Population

The population is mostly human, and the ruling guilds are almost exclusively human. There is a small gnomish quarter which consists mostly of artificers. There are few elves or halflings, but a reasonable number of dwarvern traders and militia.

## The Guilds

Mavi is technically a kingdom, but almost all powers have been delegated to a series of major guilds. Each guild jealously guards its powers and attempts to use them as leverage over the others:

### His Majesty's Actuaries

Responsible for entry and exit taxation. Also responsible for administration of the indentured servitude contract system.

### The Thaumaturgic Order

They control access to magical items and knowledge within the city (which is generally restricted to guild members or those willing to pay a large access fee). They also regulate magic use (a license is required).

### The Priest's Guild

They regulate temples and even personal prayer. They tax, license, and fix prices for clerical services and collect a tithe. Permitted deities:

 * Boccob
 * Delleb
 * Heironeous
 * Hextor
 * Moradin
 * Sekolah
 * St. Cuthbert
 * Wee Jas

### The Blue Guard

Acts as a watch policing "crimes against the king". Technically crimes against the person (such as robbery) should be policed and put before a Sheriff by the victim, but in practice the watch are privately contracted in most cases. Also responsible for guarding the city wall from threats from outside.

### Courtiers

The aristocracy functions as a guild. A title can be purchased or inherited, but there is a complex code of chivalry to be administered.

### The Worshipful Company of Bailiffs

Responsible for enforcement of sheriff's orders and bounties. Unofficially the guild also arranges for items to be "clandestinely accquired" to order.
