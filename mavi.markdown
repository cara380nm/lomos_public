#Mavi

A small city of 12000, positioned on the edge of the desert where the land is still just capable of sustaining crops. The city is notable for its unusual structure, effectively ruled over by guilds. It has an usually long wall surrounding the entire city. The wall is a callback to the days of Dragon raids, but now acts simply to regulate population movement.
